                <p>Polo is a progressive barangays which lies close to the poblacion.  How barangay Polo got its name is another case of mis-information due to the language barrier between the ruling Spaniards and the local inhabitants. <br>

                  Once in that particular settlement which we now popularly called Polo, a group of traveling Spaniard came upon a man who was making a “po-eo” or handle for his bolo.  Being strangers in that place, they asked the man what the name of the place was.  The native thought that they were asking him about what he was making.  So he answered, “po-eo” or polo.  Since a non-speaking Aklanon can rarely pronounce the peculiar diphthong “eo” and instead use “lo” and thus since then the place was called “POLO”.  <br>
                
                  Today, Polo is the site of two religious: the Welcome Home of the Saviour, a home for the destitute, the age that the dying and serves as an orphanage as well.  It is run by the Missionaries of Charity of Mother Teresa of India.  The other institution is the Immaculata Adoration Convent of the Pink Sisters, a contemplative congregation.  There also stands now, a new constructed Polo Baptist Church in this barangay.

                <p>Cawayan is the present official  name of this barrio which it was popular known from the beginning.  This name was derived according to a legend during the invasion of the Moros. <br>

                  There was once a sailboat owned by the Moros which was totally wrecked and entirely smashed into places due to a heavy storm.  When the weather was clear, it was discovered that the riggers or katig made of bamboos were washed ashore by strong waves at a point located  in the western extremities of the present barrio CAWAYAN.  From that time on, bamboos of different kinds such as anono-o, butong, and another specie called “Cawayan”, were soon growing along the banks of the Lagatik River and at the southwestern part of Cawayan.  Since then, the barrio was popularly and commonly called “CAWAYAN”. <br> 
                
                  The name of the sitios included within its territorial jurisdiction are known as Tugbungan, Baybay, Ilawod, and Ilaya.

                <p>The original of this former sitio of Fonda Lagatik was Kuntang.  It was changed to Ochando after the last Spanish Government of Capiz Federico Ochando to make a good impression during his visit. <br>

                  OCHANDO is a peaceful fishing village.  Lagatik River and Sibuyan Sea were abundant sources of fish and other marine resources.  These products were transported by bancas from  Tugbungan were merchants convene to exchange and bring home products from interior barangays and the towns of Batan, Balete and Banga.  Agricultural products like copra made the landed owners well-off and highly respected.  A small area for rice culture helped augment the food necessities of farmers.<br>
                
                  OCHANDO later became the seat of the first of a series of blood compact called Pacto de Sangre, famous of whom were Valeriano Dalida of the Historical 19 Martyrs of Aklan, and Albino Rabaria, his constant companion in association with Gen. Francisco del Castillo’s crusade, disguising as pearl divers.<br>
                
                  The revolution that followed brought about the rise of the Iglesia Independiente, a religious sect that defected from the Roman Catholic Church because of the oppressions of the Spanish Priests and authorities.  A Shrine to that effect stands in the hearth of this barangay.  Another shrine was erected  and blessed last March 2, 1997 to commemorate the Centennial year of the landing and signing of the Pact headed by Gen.  Castillo.  This was done at Tugbungan now called sitio Kuntang to retain the old name of Ochando.<br>
                
                  OCHANDO folks are forever hungry for education, the reason why it became the first barangay of the combined district of Batan and New Washington to organize a complete elementary school in 1947.  The first barangay too, to hold a District Meet with then mestizo-looking  and English speaking Diosdado Delfin as District Supervisor.  This resulted to a growth of professionals  from teachers to nurses, engineers, doctors, lawyers; priests (Rev. Rosalina Villaruel Rabaria, the first woman priest in the Phil. Is a granddaughter of the signatories), men and women across the seas who have contributed much to uplift the lives of their families and the barangay as a whole.

                  Barangay Fatima was popularly known as Ea-aw or Parola before its separation.  This is so because it is in this barangay where the seaman’s beacon is located.  The lighthouse, locally known as parola, beacons all sailors towards Batan Bay and then to Lagatik River and which is located at Floripon Point of this Barangay. <br>
                
                  A tiny barangay, Fatima used to be the minor sitio of the popular Dumaguit.  Landholding in this barangay owned by a few big land owners from Batan.  With fishing and coconut farming as the main livelihood of the barangay folks, the inhabitants live on a hand to mouth basis. And so it has been that way for years. <br>
                
                  The Barangays sovereignty was swakened in early 1950’s when, with a new dynamic and talented leader from the town, people saw the need for being independent from the mother barangay.  With the help of a big landholder, the dream of the impoverished Fatima resident came into reality when a bill was presented to the new mayor, Atty. Bartolome L. Venus and the able assistance of the late Don Tomas Sta. Maria Bautista, Barangay Fatima was born. <br>
                
                  That was in the year 1956 when a new name Fatima was given to it because the religious Don Tomas Sta. Maria Bautista wanted to name the barangay in honor of Our Lady Fatima.  From that time on, progress has been steady.  First, Tomas Bautista donated a piece of land where the first barangay primary school was erected.  Then he donated another piece of his land for the construction of a Multi-Purpose Center with stage.  This was followed with another land donation where the barangay hall has bee n constructed and more for the construction of more roads (an extension of the old road from Ochando to the lighthouse).  Lately, when the barangay school has to be relocated due to eroded shorelines one of the daughters of the late Tomas Bautista, Sr. Oliva Bautista Meñez, wife of Dr. Antonio D. Meñez, donated another piece of lot  for a new Bagong Lipunan type school building. <br>
                
                  Barangay Fatima has now two major roads.  These are the Parola and Del Rosario Roads whose total length is 4.810 kms.  Both are maintained with funds given by the national government.  One can now reach the barangay through the Parola Barangay Road through sitio Bato from Barangay Ochando (through the Mantangue Hill) go eastward, then southward and back westward to ochando on the Ochando-Dumaguit boundary.  The roads are well maintained thru the able management of our barangay officials.

                <p>This island barangay is named Pinamuk-an derived from the dialect word “pinamuk-an” meaning a place where many were choked.  It was told that many people were choked there during the Spanish time. <br>

                  Usual stories about how a place get its name tend to revolve around a peculiar incidents, geographic feature, plant or tree or way of living in that particular locality.  Thus, some sitios of Pinamuk-an have these stories to tell. <br>
                
                  Sitio Maguey – there was once a bid maguey plant on the bank of a nearby river where the boats are tied to it when anchored.  When folks from other places anchor by and ask where they could tie their boats, the usual answer was “sa maguey”.  From then on the place was called “Maguey”. <br>
                
                  Sitio Matuod – this is a very small island near the barrio.  A long time ago, a well known person was killed in that place and when investigated, a man bravely stood to tell the truth as to who killed that person: “Matu-od” means “true”. <br>
                
                  Sitio Bad-as – is derived from the word “eab-as” meaning fresh.  Fresh fish were brought to this sitio to be dried and thus the place was called Bad-as. <br>
                
                  Sitio Soli – the name was derived from a structure of a small brook flowing toward the river located in that sitio.  The inside part is much wider that the mouth so it looks like in a reverse position.  Thus the place was called “soli”. <br>
                
                  A simboryo,  well known for its tower, still stands in Pinamuk-an and it was believed to be a docking place during the Spanish time.

                <p>TAMBAK is the popular name of this barrio or barangay which is the gateway to the Poblacion.  It got its name from a native word “tambak” which means to fill or “filled up place”.  Formerly, this place was swampy and often submerged by the tide.  So the inhabitants of the place group together and work to fill up the low level land to make fortify their surroundings from the rushing waves and upcoming tide. <br>

                  There were no written record as to when Tambak was established but according to the old folks they reckon that Tambak had been established even before the Spaniards came.  That also holds true to the two sitios of Saugan and Dumlog. <br>
                
                  Marked in the map of this barrio, the sea shore used to half a kilometer away from the provincial road with coconut trees and mangroves swayed its luxurious growth along the sea coast.  At present you will see that the shore is only a few meters away and if not for the stretch of sea wall built thru the help and prodding of our very own His Eminence, Jaime Cardinal L. Sin during the term of President Corazon C. Aquino, Tambak might be non-existent to this day.  Today, Tambak is a beautiful place attracting local tourist who wish to relax and go swimming at the Municipal Tree Park and Beach Resort.

                <p>South of Barangay Tambak, across the Mabilo River lies barangay Mabilo of New Washington distinguishing it from Barangay Mabilo of Kalibo.  It was told that Mabilo got its name from a big mabolo tree that stood there.  However, more research or possibly, interviews with the old folks of the barangay can enlighten us about how Mabilo got its name as no information along this line can be heard or read about.  And That there are no writers nor historians in this barrio. <br>
                  Curiously, however, we are amused by the very names of its sitios or puroks. 
                  Eobeob was named after a big mud hole in the place. 
                  Pinatwad was named after a person who was turned up-side-down.
                Amomo-ong is the local name of a particular kind of bee, and was popularized when a 
                person was strung by a  bumble bee in that sitio
                  Eo-way was named after a tree found in that sitio.
                  Quito is named after the owner of the sitio.
                  Soebod is named after the crooked trail in going to that interior sitio.
                  Tabay is named after the small river located in that sitio.
                  Eoho was named after a deep hole on the ground.
                  Eo-ok was named after a person who was choked to death or “gin-eo-ok”.

                <p>A historical site prominent in Barangay Puis is a marker located in Sitio Mahabang Bantud which is made of stone of about eight feet high and two and a half feet wide.  On its three sides are markings of the name of each town:  Batan, Kalibo and Banga.  This marker is the boundary of these three municipalities.  Note that this barangay, being part of New Washington used to be part of Batan. <br>

                  The present official name of this barangay is PUIS.  The name is a corruption of the Spanish word, “Pues”, which is literally translated as “well”, a word used by the Spanish Officer who settled the boundary disputes between the municipality of Kalibo, Banga and Batan.  After having heard the declaration of both sides and having satisfied himself about the matter, the Spanish Officer resolving said:  Pues, areglado, retiros.”  The people, who never had knowledge of the Spanish language construed this to be the new name of barrio Puis and this was told to one another.  From then on the barangay has been named PUIS.

                <p>“HAEAS” in the aklan dialect is the name of a kind of grass having long leaves and sharp blades.  The name of this barrio “Jalas” was derived from it. <br>

                  It was told that the Spanish officer while walking along was entangled by this grass and was hurt by the sharp blades of its leaves.  Irritatingly, the officer asked what kind of grass it was and the native answered “Haeas”.  Then the Spanish asked, “Como Jalas?” meaning “what is Jalas?” and the people thought that the officer was naming their barrio “Jalas”.  From then on, this barrio was called “Jalas”.

                <p>In the seventeenth century, in about the year 1788, a settlement of native inhabitants was found at a place now called Guinbaliwan.  Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the inhabitants were divided into puroks or sitios namely: Guintampa-an, Hinogasanb, Bugasongan, Kalampayan and Dihong. <br>

                  The story of the barrio reveals that in the early part of the seventeenth century, people were engaged in a day to day living of fresh water catching fishes for food and for trade.  While some were occupied in catching fish, the world suddenly darkened, followed by heavy rains, thunder and lightning.  Those who were fishing were struch by lightning and they died.  The people believed that those who died were “guin baliw” or were punished by God, hence the name “Guinbaliwan” up to this day.

                <p>Once, in the early days, it was the practice of the farmers in this barrio to wake up early in the morning to bring their carabaos to graze.  This, they had to do because almost all the land in that barrio were planted to rice.  Hence, there was not much place left for their carabaos to graze.  So they had to give ample time for their carabaos to eat little by little until it had enough for himself to be ready for the whole days toil ahead.  This leaves the farmers lack of sleep and while at work in the fields, they intermittently  shout the word “Mataphao” meaning light, since their bodies felt lighter for lack of sleep.  With that, the farmer meant to say that his body was light and uneasy because of lack of sleep yet still had the courage and industry to work and toil all day long. <br>

                  A passer-by heard this shout and remembers it until he reached the place where he was going.  He told the story to the folks back home, and they decided to call that barrio, “Mataphao”.

                <p>Ask the people of Candelaria as to when the barrio was established and why the name “Candelaria” and they tell you, the name was derived from the Patron Saint of the barrio, that when the image of Our Lady of Candles or Nuestra Sra. Del Candelaria was introduce to the barrio folks t accept as their Patron saint then people called the place Candelaria after her. Probably, they said, in 1860 they began to renovate Sta. Maria Del Candelaria and since then is their Patron Saint. <br>

                  To people outside the barrio, the name Strella or sapa was the earliest name of the barrio.  Whichever is correct, the fact is, that, the barrio comprised the present three barrios of Jugas, Lawa-an, and Candelaria.  In other words, Jugas and lawa-an were under the territorial jurisdiction of Estrella or sapa.<br>
                
                  “Estrella”, meaning star, suggests the seemingly three tipped star formation of the three barrios in the olden days.<br>
                
                  “Sapa” too, because of the river (sapa, native dialect) winding down from Lawa-an through the adjoining barrios of Jugas and Candelaria.  Sapa was most often mentioned by the old folks when referring to earliest name of Candelaria.<br>
                
                  Estrella or Sapa, from the earliest to the later of Spanish occupation was under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Batan.  Not until 1904 when Lagatik (at present Municipality of New Washington) became a town when it was placed the latter’s jurisdiction.<br>
                
                When Lagatik become a town, Estrella or Sapa was, long before, divided or the two sitios, Jugas and Lawa-an were separated to become a district barrio from each other.  It was during the term of Tan Climaco Barrios of Batan when Jugas and Lawa-an ceased to be sitios of Estrella of Sapa.  No one can tell us from what year Tan Maco became the head of the town of Batan.  But it was he who made the separation of three barrios possible.

                <p>Lawa-an, derived its name from a big Lawa-an tree that grew at the western part of the barrio.  No one can tell us what the name of this barrio before the tree grew in that place.  It would be enough for us to believe that lawa-an has had that name from the earliest time to the present.  Or we might say that, the later generations were the one who initiated or gave to that name because of the unknown occurrence that had taken place in this barrio.

                <p>Barangay Jugas derived its name from the visayan word “hugas” meaning to wash.  It was believed that in the early days of Spanish Colonization of the Philippines, the Moro pirates had reached this place to plunder, it being accessible through, a river that flows out to Batan Bay.  Known to be a brave people, the inhabitants of that settlement must have fought back these Moro pirates in order to defend themselves and to protect their families and their properties as well.  In one of their skirmishes, a Moro was killed in the present Sitio of Dangawan.  The native brought the slain body in a nearby river ( which separates Jugas from Caiyang, Batan) to be washed.  A Spanish passer by asked the native what the name of the place was and the native, not comprehending his language thought that the Spanish was asking him what he was doing.  He answer in his native tongue saying “naga hugas” as he was washing, the slain body of the Moro.  The Spaniards then thought that the name of that place was “Jugas” and that was the beginning when the sitio was started to be called “Jugas”.  No doubt about it, this is the popular version of the  barrio folks as to how Jugas got its name.</p>
