              <p>A long, narrow strip of coastal town in the Eastern District of the Province of 
                Aklan, the Municipality of New Washington stretches downward, bounding the estuary 
                of the Batan Bay to the south-easternmost, where its long, bending coastlines face the 
                vast Sibuyan Sea on the eastern seaboard. On the western side of the peninsula, it is 
                bordered by the smooth brackish water of the Batan Bay and its tributaries, most 
                prominently the Lagatik River. <br>
                Formerly known as “Fonda Lagatic” during the Spanish colonial rule, the 
                municipality was a small but thriving river-bank settlement. It was named after the 
                Lagatic River, where it is situated. As an important settlement within the“Batang” 
                (present-day Batan) territory, just across the“Batang Bay” on its northeastern point, it 
                offers a safe, natural harbor for“paraws”(small sailboats) and balandras (sea vessels) 
                and a lucrative trading post. <br>
                Because of its strategic location, “Fonda Lagatic” was once the seat of power 
                of the third Chieftain of “Akean”, “Datu Bindahara Kalantiaw”. “Datu Kalantiaw” was 
                the descendant of one of the ten “Bornean Datus”, who according to the popular 
                legend told in the Visayan Chronicle known as “Maragtas”, purchased the Island of 
                Madya-as (present-day Panay Island) from “Marikudo”, the chieftain of the native 
                “Aetas” who inhabited the island. <br>
                At the onset of the Philippine Revolution against Spain in 1897, “Fonda Lagatic” 
                was one of the strategic places in the Visayas where the Katipunan, lead by Andres 
                Bonifacio, organized the local revolutionary movement. It gave birth to the historic 
                “Pacto de Sangre,” a secret revolutionary pact by a handful but patriotic native young 
                men in “Sitio Kuntang” Fonda Lagatic on March 3, 1897. The local “Katipuneros” 
                incised their forearms and used their own blood to affix their signatures and to signal 
                the start of the revolution in Aklan. <br>
                In April 4, 1903, when the Americans established their new colonial rule in the 
                Philippines, the residents of Fonda Lagatic petitioned the Philippine Commission to 
                create the settlements of “Batang, Jimeno” (present-day Altavas), Balete, and Fonda 
                Lagatic into a new municipality to be named New Washington, in honor of the first 
                President of the United States of America, George Washington. The seat of 
                government was established in “Fonda Lagatic”.<br>
                In January 1904, Mr. Juan Oquendo of Balete was elected as the Municipal 
                President during New Washington’s first municipal elections. The newly-formed 
                municipality was inaugurated and the first set of municipal officials was sworn into 
                office. <br>
                The three settlements of “Batan”, “Jimeno”, and “Balete” later on asked for 
                separation from New Washington to become new independent municipalities. The 
                municipality was left with the main coastal lands, an islet just across the Lagatic River and the river tributaries, marshlands and forest mangroves in the coastal area, and 
                plain farmlands in the interior frontier. 
                When Aklan separated from Capiz on April 25, 1956, New Washington became 
                one of the seventeen (17) municipalities of the newly created province. Presently, New 
                Washington has comprised of sixteen (16) barangays; eight (8) barangays in the 
                coastal areas, and eight (8) in the farmlands. 
                It ranks third among the most progressive municipalities in Aklan namely: 
                Kalibo, Malay, New Washington, and Ibajay in terms of population, trade and 
                commerce, tourism industry, infrastructure projects, and other major investment 
                programs. <br>
                Since 1904, The Municipality of New Washington has elected eighteen (18) 
                Municipal Mayors to be the LCE. Honorable Jessica Regenio-Panambo is the present 
                Municipal Mayor. She was elected on May 9, 2022.</p>

                <span><STRONG>GEOGRAPHY</STRONG></span><br>
                <p>New Washington is located at 11°38′54″N 122°26′02″E. 

                New Washington is bounded by Batan in the east, Kalibo in the west and the Sibuyan Sea on the north. It is 7 kilometers (4.3 mi) from Kalibo International Airport, 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) from the province's capital town of Kalibo, and one and a half (11⁄2) hours away from Boracay Island. </p> <br>
                <span><STRONG>CLIMATE</STRONG></span><br>
                <p>The third type of climate predominates in the locality, season not pronounced. It is relatively dry from February to July and wet the rest of the year.

                Of note, to deal with water supply along the long peninsula affected by salt water intrusion and related endemic amoebiasis, New Washington was the site of a unique U.S. Peace Corps-sponsored program to build over 200 low-cost circular water wells using locally produced "curved hollow blocks" made locally using custom wooden forms inspired by a local medical doctor and charismatic social activist Andronico "Andrew" Mendoza. Dr. Mendoza organized families to transport individual pre-cast custom hollow blocks to remote areas; the unique design of the locally designed wells obviated the need for expensive and unwieldy steel bar reinforcement. During the early 1980s, each of the 212 water well was dug and constructed throughout this municipality with voluntary community effort ("bayanihan") and are still in use today and exemplifies the spirit of New Washington. </p> 

                 <span><STRONG>DEMOGRAPHICS</STRONG></span> <br>
                <p>

                Majority of the New Washingtonians, as the municipality's residents are sometimes called, are of Aklanon origin. Immigration, generally, is due to marriage and employment.

                New Washingtonians speak in Aklanon, Hiligaynon, Filipino and English, the former being their primary medium. Aklanon, as a language, is often described as a cross between Bisaya, Hiligaynon and Karay-a making it quite complicated for local and foreign tourists to speak and comprehend. This is not seen as a problem, considering that residents can speak fluent Hiligaynon, Tagalog, and English.

                The people of New Washington are predominantly Christians. Religious denominations in the municipality include Roman Catholic Church, Philippine Independent Church, Baptist churches, Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, among others.</p> 
                
                
                 <span><STRONG>CULTURAL  &#38; HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCES </STRONG></span> <br>
                <p>

                New Washington observes two annual fiestas as a town. One is a patronal fiesta in honor of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary, which is held on the second Saturday of October and the other is a civic fiesta commemorating the heroes of Pacto de Sangre, which is held from March 1 to 3. The Pacto de Sangre, or blood compact, took place in the then Sitio Kuntang (now Barangay Ochando) on March 3, 1897. It was participated in by New Washingtonians of the past as a show of support to the Filipinos' revolution against the Spaniards. A commemorative marker was put up in the area where the event took place in Barangay Ochando. While the patronal fiesta is characterized by pious reflection, the civic fiesta involves three days of merry-making. <br>


                The municipality has numerous beach resorts located near the shores from Mabilo to Dumaguit. The past decade saw an influx of inland resorts. The inland resorts in the town are mostly in Poblacion, some of which include Sampaguita Gardens Resort, Maria Mercedes Resort and Frogs Hollow Resort. For free means of leisure and entertainment, residents go to the town plaza, which houses the Jaime Cardinal L. Sin Park, the Rizal Park, the Municipal Children's Park and the Municipal Auditorium and Sports Complex.

                Well-known restaurants in the town include Oriental Flavors (fine-dining) and Poolside Restaurant at Sampaguita Gardens, and the Residence River Restaurant (Seafoods) in Tambak.</p>
